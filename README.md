## The Best 3D Game Ever! (Name W.I.P)
A year ago, I met a person who was really interested in making games; Specifically, he really wanted to learn how to use the Godot game engine. Fast forward to the present, I met another person who was similar to him: having a passion for using Godot. To find out what all the hype about Godot was, I decided to make my very first 3D game using it. The objective is simple: try not to get knocked off the platforms by shooting the bats!
